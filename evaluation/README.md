# Control Variates Evaluation - Evaluation

Change directory to `evaluation/`. Then add `src/` to `PYTHONPATH` variable. After that, run
```bash
bash scripts/eval_chatbotarena_armorm.sh
```
as well as other scripts in `scripts/`.

Note: When running scripts with names including `grm`, use the following package versions to ensure the code runs correctly:
```txt
trl==0.11.0
transformers==4.40.0
```
